# Odin Project Landing Page

## Description

This is a landing page designed for The Odin Project HTML/CSS assignment. I used the basic requirmentsand to create a landing page. The layout of the code uses flexbox layout and I used both inline and external CSS coding to create the styling. This is a simple landing page created to showcase a layout and style using the box model. I gained a better understanding of how to use flexbox and how to create a simple layout using HTML and CSS, as well as some needed practise in layout structure.
